start learning java. 


#first define package with 'package 
package my package.one.tw..... 

#after package import classes 
import java.utils.scanner 




//private  , public , default 
public class must have the same name as  file . 
private class just should in another method in the class that  
choose access types of members or other method . 
private member just got access to that class is in . 



error when 2 class with the same public access in one file . 
:: first.java:3: error: class newClass is public, should be declared in a file named newClass.java
public class newClass{
       ^


if a method in private access not could be used from another class . 


class couldn't be private but methods and variables could . 



*********        important compiling more related file . ***************** 
when we have more than one package related each other we should compile them with 
"-d " command to not got error in java.   
its important because don't : java couldn't find the packs. 
for example  with this path below : 

.
├── dir1
│   └── fil_dir
│       └── another.java
├── dir2
    └── lil_dir
        └── first.java

// we should run command in this way to do.  where we are in the parent of both 'dir1' and 'dir2'
" javac -d . dir1\fil_dir\another.java dir2\lil_dir\first.java " 

after that when we need to run the code we should use another way to run . 
we should run 'java' run command  in shell where we compile all file . 
then the specific command to run it is : 
" java   dir2.lil_dir.first "    
and its run successfully. 

***
so for this if wrong  we got the error below : 
'''
C:\Users\beta\Documents\web_server_java\web_server\learn_java\zerr\dir2\lil_dir>java first.class
Error: Could not find or load main class first.class
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: first.class
